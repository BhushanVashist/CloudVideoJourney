1. Docker network ls  --> Lists all the network
2. Docker network --create myNet   --> Creates a network named myNet (of bridge type) (Containers within the same network can communicate)

3. Docker run -it --name contA --network myNet alpine sh
	here,
	    contA is the name of the container
	    myNet is the network
            alpine is the docker image (begin pulled from docker, if not exist)
            sh is the shell of alpine
	    -it is necessary for keeping the sh open, if -it not used then the shell will open and exit immediately

4. Docker run -it --name contB --network myNet alpine sh 
	here,
   	   contB is another container within the same network

5. Now, use ping contA from the sh of the contB, and they ping each other as they are in same network.

6. docker run -dit --name contWeb --network myNet -p 8080:80 nginx
	-dit → run in background with terminal.
	--network myNet → put it on the same custom network.
	-p 8080:80 → maps your local machine’s port 8080 to container’s port 80.
